    <h1>Living behind the mask</h1>
    <p>
    I learned to “act normal” long before i understood why everything felt difficult.
    In school, with my family, even in relationships — everyone expected me to be
    more social, more talkative, more spontaneous. But i did not know how.
  </p>

  <p>
    When people made jokes, i laughed even if I did not understand them.
    I tried to talk more even when my words felt stuck,
    and i copied the way others behaved so I could blend in.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the outside, it looked like i was fine.
    But inside, i was working — constantly.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="quote">
    “Masking is not pretending to be someone else.  
     It is trying to be the version of you that people wont reject.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    And there was something else too. I stutter.
    So on top of trying to understand people,
    i was also trying to control my voice.
    The more nervous i felt, the harder it became.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes, because of all that effort, i came across as distant or cold.
    People thought i did not care, or that i lacked empathy.
    But the truth was the opposite:
    I was feeling everything too deeply — i just did not know how to show it
    in the way others expected.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also took things literally. I understood words exactly as they were said,
    and not always the hidden meanings, sarcasm, or “between the lines” messages.
    That led to misunderstandings — not because i did not care, but because
    i was speaking honestly, directly, and in my own language.
  </p>

  <p>
    After social situations, i often felt ashamed —
    like i had done everything wrong,
    even when no one had actually said anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is the part of autism people does not see:
    the silent effort, the invisible work,
    the exhaustion that comes from simply trying to exist
    in a world that does not speak your language.
