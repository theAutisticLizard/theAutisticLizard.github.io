                <h3 class="poem-title">Your eyes speak</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    We once dreamed of being two stars in our own vastness. Now I'm trapped in a desolate line of life. Day and night feel so strange without you. The innocence and the madness of the love we shared still sleep inside my eyes. You were my only desire; you were that place where peace met my soul. I loved you endlessly, but you will never understand. My impatient, anxious heart only wants to see you, and you don't realize how deeply in love I was. Sometimes tears break open in my eyes, and desperation gets stuck in my throat. You turned your back on someone who already carried too many wounds. I guess now I'll just be a broken, wandering star, traveling through the infinite spaces where we once lived.

                <h3 class="poem-title">A shadow trying to bloom</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    On my lips lives the kiss that never came to be, and in my voice a prayer for your return. I saw you sitting in my dreams, you looked like an angel —I was hallucinating, my eyes refused to part from you. My hope burns, and my heart is trapped inside the smoke. I am a forgotten shadow— where do I find fertile ground to be born again? Perhaps this is a punishment? How do I explain that your love is a flower trying to bloom in my barren fate? My heart has broken before, but without you my life lies down in a river of tears —and I don’t know if I can cross it.

                <h3 class="poem-title">Return color to my shadowed world</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Don’t you see it, my love? You pushed my destiny into the void. My melancholy waits inside the box of our memories. Come now, silence this sadness— come now and wrap me in your skin. What can I tell my heart, when your absence soaks it in fear? Bring the colors back to my shadowed world. Come here— you are my only desire.
                </p>

                <h3 class="poem-title">Broken under your absence</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Love, why did you surrender me to loneliness? You’re not here, and my mind feels lost. Let me cry for you, let me miss you— what else can I do? All I gained were false promises, words already dead. All this anger, all this rage now camouflaged in tears… and all the love that vanished— you held the reins, my life. That illusion of kissing you beneath the veil and eternal fire— all of it forgotten. You take the best of me and leave me defeated. The memory of your gentle smile, my beloved, waits for me every night. You were only mine, I was only yours— and everything shattered. Distance will make you forget me, but it will wound me every single day.

                <h3 class="poem-title">You were mine until you weren´t</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    My love, you are no longer mine. What was my mistake? Neither my affection nor my time were ever enough. Where did our precious moments go? Pieces of my heart are scattered across my room. My love— my soul searches only for your name. Whisper to me again that you are mine. My skin refuses to wander into another’s warmth. Make me yours again. Do you not remember the madness that fell upon us? Do you never think of the way love used to hold us? Your love felt so entirely mine, and my love was so completely yours.
                </p>

                <h3 class="poem-title">The storm you left at my door</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Were you ever truly mine? My love, look closely— you left my soul in ruins. You forgot to take with you the moments you once gave me. Take everything that ever bound us together. I will gather, in pain, the pieces of our unfinished story. Perhaps you’ll never understand the greatness with which my eyes once looked at you. My love, you will never know the wounds I carried in my loneliness. Would you even have the strength to face that agony? If only your skin were my skin— if only you would stop and listen to me, just for a moment, my love— perhaps then you would understand the storm you left at my door.

                <h3 class="poem-title">What your silence reveals</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Angel, how can you say so much with your silence? Did your heart hide itself behind a curtain of apathy? Or were you always this way? I’m left confused— your lies made me wait for you. So many promises, so many dreams… was it all truly a lie? Now it’s getting late, and waiting has become a poison. How do I hold on to reality? Perhaps time will place my words inside your eyes— perhaps my silence will make the truth speak. You can hide, but you will feel my absence. Somehow, somewhere, you will see my name— because my heart always feared your leaving.
                </p>

                <h3 class="poem-title">We once melt for each other</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Do you remember when we melted into each other? When our damp eyes could understand everything without a single word? What happened to your heart, that it no longer answers the way it used to? Does the echo of my love no longer resonate within your space? My whole world used to disappear into the pleasure of your voice… What happened, my love? Why does everything feel so numb now? My ears keep rewinding your laughter— I’m trapped day and night in your memory, my life. Is this the emptiness that grief leaves behind? Darling, look through your notes— you’ll find our story there again.

                <h3 class="poem-title">The butterflies left with you</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    You let misfortune gather me into its arms once again. You forgot the tenderness with which we once looked at each other. I felt so lucky resting at your side— you owned everything, listen, my love, everything. I felt like a victor in a story doomed to fail; the victory was ours, yet you left me alone. My drowsy heart, so tired from missing you— can you feel it? My love, even the days seem dark now; the beauty of the sky has changed as well. From your eyes I used to gather flowers— where did you take the whole garden? You left, and the butterflies left with you. You stretched time until our paths split apart. I remained on the ground while you looked down at me from above. Are we truly so different? Our moments whispered something else to me.

            <div class="poem-card">
                <h3 class="poem-title">Slow motion</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Rain falls into my eyes in slow motion. I never wanted to say goodbye. You even took with you the deepest words I could never say aloud. I am the lonely one who opened his whole world to you— because you were the only one. My heartbeat understands only the language of your love; every fiber of my being hungers for it. My lips, thirsty for yours— I want to intoxicate myself one more time. Your face echoes around me, everywhere. What have you done, my love? Break this spell— please, break it now. I will become an empty leaf wandering with your memory. Your beautiful eyes brushed against mine; even at a distance we somehow found each other so close. Was it all a dream? Was it all a lie? Make me believe otherwise, my love. Take me back to that special moment where love awoke.

                <h3 class="poem-title">What made you let me fall</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Rage is truly a dishonest place— why did you let it end like this? My clumsy heart cannot forget you; it shattered badly the moment you walked away. You held me in your hands, then let me fall. I crashed harshly against reality, losing my sanity for you, my love. Our moments now are a grave— everything dried up, everything stopped. I held you so close to my desires, yet not close enough to make you stay. I keep waiting… I keep dreaming of breathing your skin. Perhaps you’ll never understand my love— I fought the world for you. Now I am only a ghost, wandering through your streets. Inside my chest your name is nailed— the name only you and I once whispered. Was your fragrance ever mine? My soul still searches for your presence.

            <div class="poem-card">
                <h3 class="poem-title">Let me bow before you one last time</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Come, my love— tonight I will bow before you. I remained inside myself for far too long; listen to my prayers for your return. Take me to a place where guilt does not exist, where loneliness is not so heavy. I search for you everywhere, my love— let me find you again. This distance not only hurts— it changes everything, my love. Do my eyes not haunt your dreams? Does the distance not burn your chest the way it burns mine? I can smell the chaos inside me— let me breathe your essence again. Do not let your smile fade from my memory. Do not torment me with the ruin your goodbye left behind. Has hope abandoned our worlds? Have the shadows truly not left us? Tonight, I will bow before you.

                <h3 class="poem-title">Where your name refuses to leave me</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Your name burns through my blood, yet my heart bleeds because of you. I wish I could close my eyes and, upon opening them, to see you before anything else. The mirror of your love shatters— and its fragments cut into every corner of my being. Ay, my love… I remember how your skin intoxicated me, and now I can’t wake up from this bitter dream. Your name lives in every space of my life. I hide, I run, yet it’s always there. Through tears I keep searching for you, but nothing is enough. Do not punish me any longer, my love. These hours are harsh, and all I do is remember your name.

                <h3 class="poem-title">My heart still has so many questions</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    My heart still holds so many questions— why did you abandon our dreams? I look at the moon, and all I see is a wounded story. How I wish I could tell you about my pain, and how every minute without you feels agonizing. How do I tell the world that you were everything sweet I ever imagined? My heart is lost now— it no longer knows where to go. My love, what did you do to my dreams? Everything has lost its meaning. Even luck and the gods have forgotten me. My heart finds shelter only in the nostalgia of your goodbye. A hesitant destiny— and here, it only rains. My poems speak only of sorrow, broken lines falling over me.

                <h3 class="poem-title">As distant as earth from sky</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Why did you lose yourself in someone else’s lips while I was losing myself in you? Every false promise your mouth ever gave haunts me, torments me. How do I explain that your betrayal even stopped my breath? My words fall like my tears— what did I do, my love? Now you are so far away, as distant from me as the earth is from the sky.
                </p>

                <h3 class="poem-title">Every heartbeat runs out of time</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Do you not see that you’re the only thing I write about? That your image is the first thing I see, and with it, I create poetry. How I wish your love could draw a new hope again— you don’t know that in your magic I once found my faith. Today, your memory feels so close, my eyes can no longer erase yours. I don’t know if God is still with me, I don’t know who guides me now. You tore everything out of me and claimed it all, my beloved. Everything in me belonged to you— how could you abandon your right to it? You stole the sweetness that bloomed between our lips; you took the laughter, the spontaneity. Do you no longer remember how my hands disappeared into your corners? How your eyes merged with the sky, how your sounds sheltered my ears? My heart no longer rests; with every beat, its time runs out.

                <h3 class="poem-title">Your false paradise</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    Why do your eyes leave a mark on me as they go? You were the only one, my love. I used to think paradise was hidden on your lips— you were a treasure. The fog of your absence won’t let me see; why do you make me breathe this loneliness? Even my bad luck feels abandoned— you left everything upside down, my love. I truly believed I lived inside the landscapes of your thoughts. Why did you make me believe that? All that comfort was false; your heart knew how to deceive mine. I wish I could run faster and escape the memory of your false love.
                </p>

            <div class="poem-card">
                <h3 class="poem-title">The nights your memory sat beside me</h3>
                <p class="poem-text">
                    I cannot tell you how many nights your memory sat beside me. Your treacherous eyes were telling the truth straight into my ears. We let love slip away— our hearts grieved so deeply that it broke the world around us. Eternity has been lost somewhere unknown… where can I find it again? My world remains silent, waiting for your love to speak to me once more. My gaze still rests within yours— let me discover you once again.
