                <h2>Your eyes speak</h2>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>We once dreamed of being two stars in our own vastness.
                    Now I'm trapped in a desolate line of life.
                    Day and night feel so strange without you.

                    The innocence and the madness of the love we shared
                    still sleep inside my eyes.

                    You were my only desire; you were that place where peace
                    met my soul. I loved you endlessly, but you will never understand.

                    My impatient, anxious heart only wants to see you,
                    and you don't realize how deeply in love I was.

                    Sometimes tears break open in my eyes,
                    and desperation gets stuck in my throat.
                    You turned your back on someone who already carried
                    too many wounds.

                    I guess now I'll just be
                    a broken, wandering star,
                    traveling through the infinite spaces
                    where we once lived.</p>
                </div>

            <!-- POEMA 2 -->
            <article class="card poem-card">
                <h2>Untitled</h2>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>On my lips lives the kiss that never came to be,
                    and in my voice a prayer for your return.

                    I saw you sitting in my dreams, you looked like an angel—
                    I was hallucinating, my eyes refused to part from you.

                    My hope burns, and my heart is trapped inside the smoke.
                    I am a forgotten shadow—
                    where do I find fertile ground to be born again?

                    How do I explain that your love is a flower
                    trying to bloom in my barren fate?

                    My heart has broken before,
                    but without you my life lies down
                    in a river of tears—
                    and I don't know if I can cross it.</p>
