                <h2>Your eyes speak</h2>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>We once dreamed of being two stars in our own vastness.
                        Now I'm trapped in a desolate line of life.
                        Day and night feel so strange without you.

                        The innocence and the madness of the love we shared
                        still sleep inside my eyes.

                        You were my only desire; you were that place where peace
                        met my soul. I loved you endlessly, but you will never understand.

                        My impatient, anxious heart only wants to see you,
                        and you don't realize how deeply in love I was.

                        Sometimes tears break open in my eyes,
                        and desperation gets stuck in my throat.
                        You turned your back on someone who already carried
                        too many wounds.

                        I guess now I'll just be
                        a broken, wandering star,
                        traveling through the infinite spaces
                        where we once lived.</p>

                <h2>A shadow trying to bloom</h2>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>
                        On my lips lives the kiss that never came to be,
                        and in my voice a prayer for your return.

                        I saw you sitting in my dreams, you looked like an angel—
                        I was hallucinating, my eyes refused to part from you.

                        My hope burns, and my heart is trapped inside the smoke.
                        I am a forgotten shadow—
                        where do I find fertile ground to be born again?
                        Perhaps this is a punishment?

                        How do I explain that your love is a flower
                        trying to bloom in my barren fate?

                        My heart has broken before,
                        but without you my life lies down
                        in a river of tears—
                        and I don’t know if I can cross it.

                    <p>Don’t you see it, my love?
                        You pushed my destiny into the void.

                        My melancholy waits inside
                        the box of our memories.

                        Come now, silence this sadness—
                        come now and wrap me in your skin.

                        What can I tell my heart,
                        when your absence soaks it in fear?

                        Bring the colors back
                        to my shadowed world.

                        Come here—
                        you are my only desire.</p>

                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>Love, why did you surrender me to loneliness?
                        You’re not here, and my mind feels lost.

                        Let me cry for you, let me miss you—
                        what else can I do?
                        All I gained were false promises,
                        words already dead.

                        All this anger, all this rage
                        now camouflaged in tears…
                        and all the love that vanished—
                        you held the reins, my life.

                        That illusion of kissing you
                        beneath the veil and eternal fire—
                        all of it forgotten.
                        You take the best of me
                        and leave me defeated.

                        The memory of your gentle smile, my beloved,
                        waits for me every night.
                        You were only mine,
                        I was only yours—
                        and everything shattered.

                        Distance will make you forget me,
                        but it will wound me
                        every single day.</p>

                        My love, you are no longer mine.
                        What was my mistake?
                        Neither my affection
                        nor my time
                        were ever enough.

                        Where did our precious moments go?
                        Pieces of my heart
                        are scattered across my room.

                        My love—
                        my soul searches only
                        for your name.
                        Whisper to me again
                        that you are mine.

                        My skin refuses
                        to wander into another’s warmth.
                        Make me yours again.

                        Do you not remember
                        the madness that fell upon us?
                        Do you never think
                        of the way love used to hold us?

                        Your love felt so entirely mine,
                        and my love
                        was so completely yours.

                    <p>Were you ever truly mine?
                        My love, look closely—
                        you left my soul in ruins.

                        You forgot to take with you
                        the moments you once gave me.
                        Take everything
                        that ever bound us together.

                        I will gather, in pain,
                        the pieces of our unfinished story.
                        Perhaps you’ll never understand
                        the greatness with which my eyes
                        once looked at you.

                        My love, you will never know
                        the wounds I carried
                        in my loneliness.
                        Would you even have the strength
                        to face that agony?

                        If only your skin were my skin—
                        if only you would stop
                        and listen to me,
                        just for a moment, my love—
                        perhaps then you would understand
                        the storm you left at my door.</p>

                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>Angel, how can you say so much
                        with your silence?
                        Did your heart hide itself
                        behind a curtain of apathy?
                        Or were you always this way?

                        I’m left confused—
                        your lies made me wait for you.
                        So many promises, so many dreams…
                        was it all truly a lie?

                        Now it’s getting late,
                        and waiting has become a poison.
                        How do I hold on
                        to reality?

                        Perhaps time will place my words
                        inside your eyes—
                        perhaps my silence
                        will make the truth speak.

                        You can hide,
                        but you will feel my absence.
                        Somehow, somewhere,
                        you will see my name—
                        because my heart
                        always feared your leaving.</p>

                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>Do you remember when we melted
                        into each other?
                        When our damp eyes
                        could understand everything
                        without a single word?

                        What happened to your heart,
                        that it no longer answers
                        the way it used to?
                        Does the echo of my love
                        no longer resonate
                        within your space?

                        My whole world used to disappear
                        into the pleasure of your voice…
                        What happened, my love?
                        Why does everything feel
                        so numb now?

                        My ears keep rewinding
                        your laughter—
                        I’m trapped day and night
                        in your memory, my life.

                        Is this the emptiness
                        that grief leaves behind?
                        Darling, look through your notes—
                        you’ll find our story
                        there again</p>
