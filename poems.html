                        A winged hope <br>

                        I hide within my dreams.
                        They don’t know my ending—
                        I, too, can be beautiful. <br>

                        I don’t seek a place in the crowd;
                        solitude is my prayer.
                        Not obsessed with winning,
                        and accustomed to losing. <br>

                        I saw my life shatter,
                        and I bloomed among stones.
                        I met thorns,
                        and made them mine.</p>
