                <h2>Your eyes speak</h2>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>We once dreamed of being two stars in our own vastness.
                        Now I'm trapped in a desolate line of life.
                        Day and night feel so strange without you.

                        The innocence and the madness of the love we shared
                        still sleep inside my eyes.

                        You were my only desire; you were that place where peace
                        met my soul. I loved you endlessly, but you will never understand.

                        My impatient, anxious heart only wants to see you,
                        and you don't realize how deeply in love I was.

                        Sometimes tears break open in my eyes,
                        and desperation gets stuck in my throat.
                        You turned your back on someone who already carried
                        too many wounds.

                        I guess now I'll just be
                        a broken, wandering star,
                        traveling through the infinite spaces
                        where we once lived.</p>

                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>
                        On my lips lives the kiss that never came to be,
                        and in my voice a prayer for your return.

                        I saw you sitting in my dreams, you looked like an angel—
                        I was hallucinating, my eyes refused to part from you.

                        My hope burns, and my heart is trapped inside the smoke.
                        I am a forgotten shadow—
                        where do I find fertile ground to be born again?
                        Perhaps this is a punishment?

                        How do I explain that your love is a flower
                        trying to bloom in my barren fate?

                        My heart has broken before,
                        but without you my life lies down
                        in a river of tears—
                        and I don’t know if I can cross it.

                    <p>Don’t you see it, my love?
                        You pushed my destiny into the void.

                        My melancholy waits inside
                        the box of our memories.

                        Come now, silence this sadness—
                        come now and wrap me in your skin.

                        What can I tell my heart,
                        when your absence soaks it in fear?

                        Bring the colors back
                        to my shadowed world.

                        Come here—
                        you are my only desire.</p>

                    <p>Love, why did you surrender me to loneliness?
                        You’re not here, and my mind feels lost.

                        Let me cry for you, let me miss you—
                        what else can I do?
                        All I gained were false promises,
                        words already dead.

                        All this anger, all this rage
                        now camouflaged in tears…
                        and all the love that vanished—
                        you held the reins, my life.

                        That illusion of kissing you
                        beneath the veil and eternal fire—
                        all of it forgotten.
                        You take the best of me
                        and leave me defeated.

                        The memory of your gentle smile, my beloved,
                        waits for me every night.
                        You were only mine,
                        I was only yours—
                        and everything shattered.

                        Distance will make you forget me,
                        but it will wound me
                        every single day.</p>

                        What was my mistake?
                        Neither my affection
                        nor my time
                        were ever enough.

                        Where did our precious moments go?
                        Pieces of my heart
                        are scattered across my room.

                        My love—
                        my soul searches only
                        for your name.
                        Whisper to me again
                        that you are mine.

                        My skin refuses
                        to wander into another’s warmth.
                        Make me yours again.

                        the madness that fell upon us?
                        Do you never think
                        of the way love used to hold us?

                        Your love felt so entirely mine,
                        and my love
                        was so completely yours.

                        You forgot to take with you

                        Take everything
                        that ever bound us together.

                        I will gather, in pain,
                        the pieces of our unfinished story.
                        Perhaps you’ll never understand

                        just for a moment, my love—

                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>Angel, how can you say so much
                        with your silence?
                        Did your heart hide itself
                        behind a curtain of apathy?
                        Or were you always this way?

                        I’m left confused—
                        your lies made me wait for you.
                        So many promises, so many dreams…
                        was it all truly a lie?

                        Now it’s getting late,
                        and waiting has become a poison.
                        How do I hold on
                        to reality?

                        Perhaps time will place my words
                        inside your eyes—
                        perhaps my silence
                        will make the truth speak.

                        You can hide,
                        but you will feel my absence.
                        Somehow, somewhere,
                        you will see my name—
                        because my heart
                        always feared your leaving.</p>

                        that grief leaves behind?
                        Darling, look through your notes—

                        I could never say aloud.

                        I am the lonely one
                        who opened his whole world
                        to you—
                        because you were
                        the only one.

                        My heartbeat understands
                        only the language
                        of your love;
                        every fiber of my being
                        hungers for it.

                        My lips, thirsty for yours—
                        I want to intoxicate myself
                        one more time.

                        Your face echoes
                        around me, everywhere.
                        What have you done,
                        my love?

                        Break this spell—
                        please, break it now.
                        I will become an empty leaf
                        wandering with your memory.

                        Your beautiful eyes
                        brushed against mine;
                        even at a distance
                        we somehow found each other
                        so close.

                        Was it all a dream?
                        Was it all a lie?

                        Make me believe otherwise,
                        my love.
                        Take me back
                        to that special moment
                        where love awoke.</p>

                <h2>What made you let me fall</h2>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>Rage is truly
                        a dishonest place—
                        why did you let it
                        end like this?

                        My clumsy heart
                        cannot forget you;
                        it shattered badly
                        the moment you walked away.

                        You held me in your hands,
                        then let me fall.
                        I crashed harshly
                        against reality,
                        losing my sanity
                        for you, my love.

                        Our moments now
                        are a grave—
                        everything dried up,
                        everything stopped.

                        I held you so close
                        to my desires,
                        yet not close enough
                        to make you stay.

                        I keep waiting…
                        I keep dreaming
                        of breathing your skin.

                        Perhaps you’ll never
                        understand my love—
                        I fought the world
                        for you.

                        Now I am only a ghost,
                        wandering through
                        your streets.

                        Inside my chest
                        your name is nailed—
                        the name only you and I
                        once whispered.

                        Was your fragrance
                        ever mine?
                        My soul still searches
                        for your presence.</p>

                <h2>Let me bow before you one last time</h2>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>Come, my love—
                        tonight I will bow before you.

                        I remained inside myself
                        for far too long;
                        listen to my prayers
                        for your return.

                        Take me to a place
                        where guilt does not exist,
                        where loneliness
                        is not so heavy.

                        I search for you everywhere,
                        my love—
                        let me find you again.

                        This distance
                        not only hurts—
                        it changes everything,
                        my love.

                        Do my eyes
                        not haunt your dreams?
                        Does the distance
                        not burn your chest
                        the way it burns mine?

                        I can smell
                        the chaos inside me—
                        let me breathe
                        your essence again.

                        Do not let your smile
                        fade from my memory.
                        Do not torment me
                        with the ruin
                        your goodbye left behind.

                        Has hope abandoned
                        our worlds?
                        Have the shadows
                        truly not left us?

                        Tonight,
                        I will bow before you.</p>
